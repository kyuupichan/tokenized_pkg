# Bitcoin Script Object Representation (BSOR)

Bitcoin script object representation is a method for encoding predefined objects in Bitcoin script. It is similar to [CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation)](https://cbor.io/) and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) in that it precedes each element with an identifier.
